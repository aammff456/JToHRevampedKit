# Welcome to the JTOHRevampedKit!

The JToHRevampedKit is a completely overhauled version of the JToH Kit. It takes advantage of optimizations to make things run much much faster while also allowing for more creative freedom.

* Works out of the box

    * No need to place scripts anywhere

* Embedded Client Objects

    * Client Objects can now be placed under any other Client Object or Server Object

* Support for multiple Towers

    * Includes the addition of a Portal along with Tower starting and ending functionality

* Custom scripting is encouraged

    * Create your own custom Tower functionality or Client Objects using the built-in modding framework

In this repository you will find detailed documentation on virtually everything contained in the Kit.
